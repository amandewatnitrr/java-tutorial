         *
         * The most important reason why static keywords are heavily used in Java is to efficiently manage memory.
         * Generally, if you want to access variables or methods inside a class, you first need to create an instance or object of that class.
         * However, there might be situations where you want to access only a couple of methods or variables of a class and you donâ€™t want...
         * .... to create a new instance for that class just for accessing these members.
         * This is where you can use the static keyword in Java.
         *
         * An Instance is an object created from class blueprint.
         * A Constructor is a special method or behaviour inside every class that creates and initializes instances.
         * The Constructor name is same as the class name/
         * The Constructor are mainly of 3 types: Default, Parameterized and Copy Constructor.
         * For return type, A Constructor always returns an instance of the class it is in.
         * We can add parameters to the constructor to give a dynamic value for each attribute.
         * The Parameter name in parameterized constructor can be different from the attribute name.
         * To access the attributes of the instance we were trying to construct, we use `this` keyword and `.` operator.
         * `This` keyword helps our program make a distinction b/w the attribute variable and parameter variable.
         * When `this` keyword is used along with `.` operator, it refers to the current instance of the class.
         *
         * Instance Methods are also reffered as non-static methods since we need an instance to use them.
         * Class methods are referred to as static methods because we do do not need an instance to use them.
         * Non-static instance variables have different values for each instance.
         * Static variables donot change for every instance they remain same for all the instances. They hold a value for whole class to use.

        /*
         * Inheritance is where one class becomes an extension of another class,..
         * ..therefore inheriting the members of the extended class.
         * There are 2 parties involved in an inheritance: Parent(SuperClass) and Child(SubClass).
         *
         * When an inheritance relationship is created b/w 2 classes, the child class
         * inherits all the attributes and methods of the parent class.
         *
         * This allows classes to reuse data that already exists within other classes.
         * Subclasses should be a more specialized form of the superclasses that they inherit from.
         *
         * A Superclass Constructor is run before the subclass constructor.
         *
         * An Explicit Call can be made to the superclass constructor from
         * one of the subclass constructors by using super().
         *
         * An Explicit Call to the superclass's constructor must be the first statement in the subclass's constructor.
         *
         * A Subclass inherits the members of its superclass.
         * However, a subclass may want to change it's behaviour of the method it inherited.
         * This is allowed bu overriding the inherited method.
         *
         * It's encouraged to use Override annotation which is the @ symbol followed by word Override.
         * This is not required but is also encouraged
         *
         * This lets Java know your intention is to override the method you inherited from your superclass.
         *
         *
         * Without this `@Override` annotation, Java will still allow you to override the method, but than you can
         * mistakenly think that you are overriding a method.
         *
         * However if the signature doesnot exactly match the inherited methode, then you wouldn't actually be
         * overriding it.
         *
         * With the Override annotation, Java will catch this and inform you the error.
         * Overloaded Methods ae methods within the same hierarchy that have the same name but different signatures but
         * different parameter list or return type.
         *
         * When dealing with a subclass, we can overload a method that we have inherited from a superclass.
         * Even though that method lives in another class
         *
         * Override and Overloading
         * To Override, a method you keep the same signature but change the body of the method.
         * To Overload, a method you keep the same name but change the signature of the method.
         *
         * A Java Class can directly inherit from one superclass.
         * However, a superclass can also inherit from another class, thus forming a chain of inheritance where the
         * subclass inherits from their Ancestor Classes as well.
         *
         * When a subclass inherits from a superclass, not everything is inherited.
         * Constructors are not technically members of a class.
         *
         * When a subclass inherits from superclass not everything is inherited.
         * Constructors are not technically members of a class, and therefore they are not inherited.
         * All public and protected methods and fields in a superclass are inherited by the subclasses.
         *
         * Private methods and fields are not inherited.
         * Final methods are inherited but cannot be overridden, meaning methods that have word final in there header,
         * these are inherited but cannot be overridden.
         * Final is a non access modifier that indicates that this is the final implementation for this method, and it
         * cannot be changed by any subclasses.
         *
         * Not only Java Classes have control over which of it's members can be inherited, but they can also restrict
         * inheritance all together, to certain subclasses.
         * Classes that restrict inheritance to certain classes are known as Sealed Classes.
         *
         * Sealed Classes are used for modelling a specific domain and control the relationship b/w classes in domain.
         * To make a class "sealed" class we write the reserved word "sealed" before the word class.
         * And than before the opening curly brace we must add the reserved word "permits" and within a comma-delimited
         * list, specify which classes are allowed to inherit from the sealed class.
         * A Sealed Class controls who can inherit from it.
         *
         * If the sealed class lists the subclass, in the permits clause the subclass is required to already exsist and
         * must have already extended the sealed class.
         *
         * Children of sealed classes are also required to declare themselves as sealed/non-sealed/final.
         *
         * non-sealed means that the class is open to be extended by any other class.
         * Any class that extends a non-sealed class is not obligated to define themselves as sealed/non-sealed/final.
         * It will simply be a normal inheritance.
         *
         * Final means that the class cannot have any subclasses. In other words, it cannot be inherited from.

         * In OOPs, is where a subclass can define it's own unique behaviour and still share some of the same behaviours

         * Overriden Methods
         * If a method is Overriden by the subclass, the polymorphic object will execute the overriden method at runtime.

         * Object Type Casting
         * The implicit or explicit act of converting an object type into a different type.
         *
         * Casting can be performed upward or downward in an inheritance tree.
         *
         * Any Java object that can pass more than one IS-A test is considered to be polymorphic.
         * An object is considered to be polymorphic if it can be assigned to a variable of more than one type.
         *
         * In Java, all Java objects are polymorphic since any object will pass the IS-A test for their own type and for
         * the class Object.
         *
         * A reference variable of a superclass type can refer to an object of the subclass type.
         * This is known as Upcasting.

        * Abstraction is a core principle of Object-Oriented Programming.
        * Abstraction is defined as something that exists in theory but doesn't have a concrete existence.
        * In Java, we have the reserved word abstract which is a non-access modifier that can be used on classes ...
        * and methods.
        * It is used when you want to define a template for a class or a method, but do not intend for it to be used as
        * .. is.
        *
        * An Abstract class is not designed to be instantiated. It's designed to be extended, thus pushing the burden of
        * implementation onto the subclass.
        * For example, a shape is an abstract concept. It can perhaps specify some general behaviours that a type of ..
        * .. shape would have, but it's too abstract of a concept to actually define what that behaviour should be.
        *
        * An Abstract class cannot be instantiated,  but its purpose is to serve as a superclass for more specific ...
        * subclasses to extend from. An Abstract method has no body. Only the signature or definition of the method ...
        * is defined. And it's not designed to run as is.
        *
        * It's designed to be overwritten by a subclass. In this case we know that one should be able to calculate ...
        * the area of a shape but how that is done depends on the type of shape that is.
        *
        * public abstract class shape{
        *   abstract  double calculateArea();

        *
        * There's no one such formula to add to the body of the calculateArea method in the shape class because it ...
        * because it literally does not exist. This meant to be a template to set a standard that any subclass of shape
        * should provide behaviour for this method.

        * Abstraction as the name implies is a tough concept to grasp.
        *
        * Abstract classes and methods are templates that are meant to be implemented by their subclasses.

        * Because of this any field defined within an interface must be constant, meaning it's static and final.
        *
        * Static: Can be accessed from any other class without any object initialization.
        * Final: Value assigned at initialization cannot be changed.
        *
        * By convention, constants are written in all caps.
        * Even if these modifiers are not explicitly written when declaring fields in an interface, it is still ...
        * implicit both static and final.
        *
        * Interfaces are used to achieve abstraction, Polymorphism in multiple inheritance
        *
        * While a class can extend only one class, it can implement multiple interfaces.
        * This how to achieve multiple inheritance in Java.
        *
        * To implement multiple inheritance, the class header must specify a comma delimited list of names ...
        * of all the interfaces that it would like to implement.
        *
        * If a class declares that it will implement multiple interfaces then it must provide implementation for ...
        * for the abstract methods of all the interfaces.
        *
        * If more than one of the interfaces being implemented contains a method with the same signature, the ...
        * implementing class can provide one overwriting implementation and that will fulfill the obligation with ...
        * all the relevant interfaces.
        *
        * However, if multiple interfaces is being implemented contain a method with the same name but with a ...
        * different return type, the class will receive an error attempting to implement them, indicating that ...
        * there is a clash.
        *
        * Methods allowed in Interfaces
        *
        * Interfaces can also contain default and static methods.
        * Unlike abstract methods both of these types of methods provide implementation.
        * In Interfaces, unless otherwise specified, the methods are implicitly public and abstract.
        *
        * So, with any new addition we have broken any non-abstract class that implemented for the Interface, cause ..
        * they are no longer adhering to the contract b/w an interface and implementing class.
        *
        * To avoid breaking all implementing classes you can define newly added method as default.
        *
        * Default Methods are methods within an interface that contain a default implementation for the method.
        * This enables you to ensure backward compatibility in implementing classes when changes are made to the ...
        * interface state implements.
        *
        * To indicate that the method is a default method, the reserved word default is used at the beginning of the ...
        * method header as follows:
        *
        * default void set_price(double price){
        *   // Body of the function
        * }
        *
        * But be very careful when implementing default methods in interfaces. Because now they are available to the ...
        * object that are instantiated with any of the classes that implement the interface.
        *
        * So, even if we were to call this method using `.` operator, it will be called even if it is not overridden ...
        * by any of the classes that implement the interface. For example:
        *
        * book.getPrice();
        *
        * While default methods provide implementation, they are not final.
        * Classes that implement interface can override the default method and provide their own implementation.
        * However, author of those classes need to be aware of the newly added methods to the interface.
        *
        * If there is no good default implementation, it may be best to leave the new method as abstract. So that, ...
        * implementing classes will get a signal in the form of a compilation error letting them know an implementation
        * ... is required.
        *
        * In addition to abstract and default methods, there is one more type of method allowed in interfaces, ...
        * Static methods.
        *
        * Static Methods are methods within an interface that contain implementation but are not inherited by ...
        * implementing classes and therefore cannot be Overwritten.
        *
        * That means an interface of static methods are not available from the instance of an implementing class ...
        * and can only be accessed from the interface itself.
        *
        * Interfaces cannot be instantiated though which is why members must be defined as static.
        * This enables us to call the static method by using the interface's name.
        *
        * This means that an interface of static methods are not available from the instance of an implementing class...
        * and can only be accessed from the interface itself.
        *
        * Interfaces cannot be instantiated though which is why the methods must be defined as static. This enables ...

     * A Collection is an object that holds reference to other objects.
     * Collections are considered Data Structures and the objects within collections are called elements.
     *
     * There are various types of collections in Java.
     * Some collections allow duplicate elements while others don't and require them to be unique.
     * Some collections are ordered while others are not.
     *
     * Collections framework is a unified architecture that provides data structures and algorithms ...
     * to manipulate them.
     *
     * Java Provides a collections framework which consists of interfaces, classes and methods to store... and
     * manipulate these group of objects.
     *
     * All the interfaces and classes for the collections framework are defined in the java.util package.
     * Collection itself is an interface and is the root of the hierarchy.
     *
     * Java does not provide any direct implementation of the collection  interface, but there are other interfaces
     * ... which inherit form the collection.
     *
     * The most common ones are set, list, queue and map.
     *
     * Set is a collection which cannot contain duplicate elements.
     *
     * List is a collection where elements are ordered. List can contain duplicate elements and the elements can ...
     * be accessed by the position they appear within the list.
     *
     * Queue is a collection of ordered elements which is typically used to hold items that are going to be ...
     * processed in some way.
     *
     * Map is a special data structure, as it does not inherit from the collection interface. However it contains ...
     * collection-like operations which enable them to be used as collections. Maps are used to hold key-value pairs.
     *
     * In addition to the collection themselves, Java also provides a collection of class which contain common ...

        * Functional Programming is a programming style that applies pure functions to an input set to produce an output.
        * It is another style of developing software that uses mathematical functions on an input to produce an output.
        *
        * A Functional Interface is an interface with just one abstract method. ...
        * This One Method is what lambda expressions and method references implement.
        *
        * Types of Interfaces:
        *
        * Consumer: It takes an input and returns nothing : void accept(T t)
        * Supplier: It takes nothing and returns an output : T get()
        * Predicate: It takes an input and returns a boolean : boolean test(T t)
        * Function: It takes an input and returns an output : R apply(T t)
        * UnaryOperator: It takes an input and returns the same type of output : T apply(T t)
        * BinaryOperator: It takes two inputs and returns the same type of output : T apply(T t1, T t2)
        *
        * where T is the type of the input and R is the type of the output.
        *
        *
        * Stream is a sequence of elements from a data source that supports aggregate operations.
        * They do not store the elements, instead, they carry the elements from a data source such as a data structure,
        * ... and allows aggregate operations to be performed on the elements without modifying the original data.
        *
        * java.util.stream package provides the Stream interface to deal with the stream of elements.
        *
        * The stream API provides several useful operations that can be performed on streams.
        * These operations can be either intermediate or terminal.
        * Intermediate operations return the resulting stream after performing an operation.
        * This enables you to continue to perform more operations on the stream if you desire.
        * Terminal operations close the stream and return a result of the operation.
        * This result can either be void or be a value. After a terminal operation ...
        * no more operations can be performed on the stream.

        /*
         * An Exception is an event that occurs at runtime due to an error.
         * It is an object that is thrown by the JVM when an error occurs.
         * 
         * Types of Exceptions:
         * 1. Checked Exceptions: These are the exceptions that are checked at compile time. They are verified by Compiler.
         * 2. Unchecked Exceptions: These are the exceptions that are not checked at compile time.
         * 
         * Exceptions are Objects, which means we have access to helpful methods for dealing with them.
         * `getMessage()` method returns the message of the exception.
         * 
         * Exceptions also have stack traces.
         * A Stack trace is an interactive log of method calls that led to a thrown exception.
         * It allows programmers to trace the path,  the program has taken and it's helpful in...
         * figuring out what and where things may have gone wrong.
         * 
         * An IOException is a checked exception, which means it must be handled or declared.
         * InputMismatchException is an unchecked exception, which means it does not need to be handled or declared.
         * 
         * There are 3 ways to handle multiple exceptions at once:
         * - Polymorphism
         * - Series of Catch Blocks
         * - Multiple Catch Blocks
         * 
         * When handling exceptions, we can use a super class, as a way to catch border exceptions.
         * All exceptions inherit from exception class.
         * 
         * We could use polymorphism, and instead of catching the IOexception, we can specify...
         * one of it's superclasses.
         * 
         * An alternative option is to use multiple catch clauses to handle different type of exceptions.
         * 
         * When resources such as input or output streams are opened and an exception interrupts ...
         * the flow of the program those resources aren't closed properly unless the programmer ...
         * took extra precautions to do so. One way to solve this is by closing the resources in a finally block.
         * But a better approach is to use try-with-resources. 
         * Try-with-resources allows you to declare resources that will be used within the try block. 
         * And Java will automatically close them for you after the execution of the block. 
         * To try-with-resources we use a set of parentheses after the word try, and inside we ...
         * declare and initialize the resource.When we have the resource...
         * declared at this level we don't need a finally clause to close the resource. 
         * You can also specify multiple resources to close.
         * 
         * Final blocks are used to execute code that must be executed no matter what.
         * 
         * Also, if you want to throw an exception of your own. Use the following method:
         * 
         * throw new IllegalArgumentException("Message");
         * 
         * Because illegal argument exception extends runtime exception, ...
         * it is an unchecked exception and we do not need to declare that our method throws this exception.
         *
